# Clustering Crypto

## Objective: 
Unsupervised learning project using Amazon SageMaker to present a report of what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how cryptocurrencies could be grouped towards creating a classification for developing a new investment product.

Demonstrating data dimension reduction with PCA and clustering the cryptocurrencies using K-Means Clustering.

## Main Tasks:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Prepare data for dimension reduction with PCA and clustering using K-Means.

- **Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA:** Reduce data dimension using the PCA algorithm from sklearn.

- **Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-Means:** Predict clusters using the cryptocurrencies data using the KMeans algorithm from sklearn.

- **Visualizing Results:** Create some plots and data tables to present results.

- **Deployment:** Deploy notebook to Amazon SageMaker.
